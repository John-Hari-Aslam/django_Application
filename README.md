# django_Application

Django poll app is a full featured polling app. You have to register in this app to show the polls and to vote. If you already voted you can not vote again. Only the owner of a poll can add poll , edit poll, update poll, delete poll , add choice, update choice, delete 
choice and end a poll. If a poll is ended it can not be voted. The End poll only shows the user the final result of the poll. There is a search option for polls. Also users can filter polls by name, publish date, and by number of votes. Pagination will work even after applying filters.
